# ebeam-algos

Early-stage, exploratory algorithms for electron-beam lithography applications. If you want to check them out, note that the plot "animations" work better in a notebook environment.

UPDATE: This repo does not contain the completed version of the algorithm, as the real version and GUI are proprietary. Email me at ayush.panta@berkeley.edu if you have any questions.
